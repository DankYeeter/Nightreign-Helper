A green suite is not evidence that anything is guarded. The evidence is a
mutation that the suite catches, and the counter-evidence -- the one this
repository keeps running into -- is a mutation that changes tens of thousands
of figures on screen and leaves every test green (QA-070, QA-073).

Each mutation is written out in full: the exact text it replaces, the exact
text it puts there, and what a reader is supposed to conclude when the suite
stays green. It is applied to a **copy** of a tree; this refuses to touch the
checkout it lives in, or any other tree with a `.git` of its own -- a second
clone or a `git worktree add` is a working tree exactly like this one, and is
the more direct path back to the unmutated source than the extraction below,
which makes it the more likely mistake, not a safer one (QA-079 b). A
half-restored mutation in a working tree is a worse outcome than any
measurement is worth:

    git archive HEAD | tar -x -C /tmp/mutant
    python scripts/differential/mutate.py --apply active-tile-only \\
        --tree /tmp/mutant
    cd /tmp/mutant && PYTHONHASHSEED=0 python -m pytest -q

The anchor of every mutation is checked by `tests/test_differential_track.py`
against the real source: if a refactoring moves the line, the registry fails
loudly instead of quietly patching nothing and reporting a green run.
